Pandy and Bunny thought Tiny was too little to play \"match.\" Tiny said, \"I can play too!\" Pandy and Bunny let Tiny try to find a match.\nTiny looked and looked. Then, he found two sticks that matched! Pandy and Bunny were surprised. They didn't think Tiny could do it. They all laughed and played together. From that day on, Pandy, Bunny, and Tiny played \"match\" and many other games together.\nThe moral of the story is: don't judge someone by their size. Everyone can do great things if they try.",

You can have this car. It's very nice. What will you call it?\"\nSam thought for a moment. He said, \"I will call it Zee. It sounds like Zoom, but it's different. Zee is my new car. I will take good care of him.\"\nSam hugged Zee and thanked his mom. He felt happy. He had replaced Zoom with Zee. He still loved Zoom, but he also loved Zee. He was ready to play with him.
